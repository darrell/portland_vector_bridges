Bridges of Portland Vector Renderings
=====================================

This repository contains vector renderings of the bridges of Portland, Oregon.
I haven't completed all of the bridges yet, only these:

 * Burnside Bridge
 * Hawthorne Bridge
 * Marquam Bridge
 * Morrisson Bridge
 * Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Bridge
 * Ross Island Bridge
 * Steel Bridge

Most are closely based on the renderings contained in the Library of
Congress's Historic American Engineering Record collection, though they are
not an exact tracing of such.

You can find the originals [at the LOC](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/or0316/)

The Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Bridge image is drawn from the engineering
diagrams available on [Trimet's Bridge pages](http://trimet.org/pm/library/bridge.htm).

The original .ai file is included, as are SVG renderings of each bridge. I've
done my best to keep them at the same relative scale, as they are in the
orignals, but it's entirely possible I botched it. SVG files are exported from
Illustrator, in SVG 1.1 format. Please let me know if you have trouble reading
them.

If you use these works, please give credit to me and to the HAER.

The original HAER drawings [are in the public
domain](http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/114_habs.html).
